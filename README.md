# Who's watching
  
This extension provides a "Viewer" attribute showing the users that are actively viewing the record.

## Working on the extension

Install [`aha-cli`](https://github.com/aha-app/aha-cli):

```sh
npm install -g aha-cli
```

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:trydionel/whos-watching-extension.git
```

**Note: In order to install an extension into your Aha! Develop account, you must be an account administrator.**

Install the extension into Aha! and set up a watcher:

```sh
aha extension:install
aha extension:watch
```

Now, any change you make inside your working copy will automatically take effect in your Aha! account.

## Building

When you have finished working on your extension, package it into a `.gz` file so that others can install it:

```sh
aha extension:build
```

After building, you can upload the `.gz` file to a publicly accessible URL, such as a GitHub release, so that others can install it using that URL.
